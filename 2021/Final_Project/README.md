# final-project-gioele_migno

The topic of the project is a 3D representation of a robotics company showroom in which several robots are shown. In the scene there are four stationary robots in T configuration and two animated ones.  One of them can be moved by the user (customer) using the keyboard directional arrows, other one instead performs a fixed animation in which the robot moves a red ball between two fixed bases placed on the table.
